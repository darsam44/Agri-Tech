We provides real-time reports on soil temperature and humidity photometric electrolyte that can be analyzed to improve and optimize
the way of grow and produce yields on farmlands.

For farmers all over the world who wants to upgrade their system efficiency and their crop productivity by combination of new technology.
"Agri-Tech" is an agriculture product with very cheap and efficient system for farmers with any size of soil.

The solution was based on LILYGO® T-Higrow sensor with ESP32 chip. Programmed with Arduino on C.
The chip works with closed code that we write into it by Arduino.
We combine in our project Internet of things(IoT): 
A neural network that composed of LILYGO® T-Higrow sensors with ESP32 chips that communicate and transmit data to each other. one device will be responsible for receiving all the information from the other devices and will be responsible for transmitting the information to the cloud. 

For using this code you need to install on your arduino this libaries:
 - `$ Esp32`
 - `$ Es esp_now`
 - `$ Es WiFi`
 - `$ FirebaseESP32`
 - `$ Adafruit_NeoPixel`
 - `$ Adafruit_BME280`
 - `$ NTPClient`

We performed an experiment to see if there was a change in the results that the sensor felt in the electrical salinity in the soil.

 The results showed that it does feel when the soil dries out and there is no water in it and we see a decrease in the percentage of salinity in the soil and when we give the soil water the sensor feel it and the percentage of salinity in the soil increases.
